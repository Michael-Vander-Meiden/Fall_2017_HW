The neural network is a python class in NN. The parameters can be seen in the class's init function. 

To train the network, simply use the main function, and create a class of neural network with the parameters you'd like.

Then, using a.fit(test_data,train_data) you can train the network on your dataset.

Below I saved some plots for the desired loss metrics.

If you would like to view the weights, you can simply call the class variable "weights"

The helper file and dataio files assist with data and some functions to make the rest of the code less cluttered.
